# Architecture Review – synthea-cli

## Summary

| Area | Strengths | Weaknesses | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Structure | Clear separation of CLI entry point and JAR management. Tests well organized. | Only single project; Docs path mismatch. | Low |
| Design Qualities | Commands validated, modular. Interfaces for process runner enable testing. | Limited extensibility beyond run command. | Medium |
| Cross-cutting | Simple progress output, caching of JAR. | No structured logging or configuration abstraction. | Medium |
| Dependencies | Minimal (.NET 8, System.CommandLine beta). JAR download automated. | Reliance on GitHub for JAR; scripts assume Debian. | Medium |
| Pipeline | setup.sh for CI, tests with high coverage, Docker instructions. | Missing Dockerfile in repo; build scripts may be out of sync. | Low |
| Documentation | README provides quick start and developer guide; Architecture diagram present. | Reference to missing docs/Architecture.md; diagrams minimal. | Medium |

## Findings

### 1. Code-base structure
- The solution uses a single console project `Synthea.Cli` and corresponding test project.
- `Program.cs` defines command-line options via System.CommandLine and delegates JAR download to `JarManager`.
- Tests are placed under `Synthea.Cli.Tests` with xUnit and cover process and network logic.
- README outlines repository layout【F:README.md†L126-L153】.
- Architecture document summarises the CLI flow with a mermaid diagram【F:docs/deliverables/Architecture.md†L5-L17】.

**Risk:** Low. Structure is straightforward but not layered for future extensions.

### 2. Design qualities
- Interfaces `IProcessRunner` and `IProcess` decouple process execution for tests【F:Synthea.Cli/Program.cs†L12-L39】.
- `JarManager` encapsulates download logic and checksum verification【F:Synthea.Cli/JarManager.cs†L10-L101】.
- Input validation for numerous options reduces invalid states.
- However the CLI currently exposes only a single `run` command; adding more commands may require modifications in Program.cs.

**Risk:** Medium. Modularity is adequate but scaling features could lead to a large Program.cs.

### 3. Cross-cutting concerns
- Caching of downloaded JAR under user profile ensures repeatable runs【F:Synthea.Cli/JarManager.cs†L30-L46】.
- Progress is reported via console but no structured logging or configuration files are used.
- Error handling mainly throws or writes to stderr; there is no retry logic for network failures.

**Risk:** Medium. Lack of logging may hinder troubleshooting in production.

### 4. Dependency management
- Uses System.CommandLine beta package in csproj【F:Synthea.Cli/Synthea.Cli.csproj†L23-L26】.
- `setup.sh` installs Java 17 and .NET 8 then publishes the tool【F:setup.sh†L1-L25】.
- The CLI downloads Synthea from GitHub at runtime, creating an external dependency.
- Scripts target Ubuntu; Windows PowerShell equivalents exist but may diverge.

**Risk:** Medium. GitHub dependency may cause availability issues.

### 5. Build & release pipeline
- Build helper `setup.sh` is used in CI and for Codex to restore and publish the tool【F:README.md†L108-L122】【F:setup.sh†L1-L25】.
- README shows Docker build/run commands but a Dockerfile is not present in the repository.
- NuGet packaging settings are included in the project file.

**Risk:** Low. Pipeline steps are simple but missing Dockerfile may confuse new contributors.

### 6. Documentation & onboarding
- README covers features, quick start, developer guide and contribution guidelines with coverage expectations【F:README.md†L33-L42】【F:README.md†L46-L121】【F:README.md†L158-L164】.
- Architecture diagram file exists but README link points to `docs/Architecture.md`, which does not exist (actual path is `docs/deliverables/Architecture.md`).
- White-paper under `docs/research` provides background but is large.

**Risk:** Medium. Onboarding is good overall but path mismatch and limited architecture details may hinder understanding.

## Recommendations

### Short-term
1. Add structured logging (e.g., `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`) with a console provider.
2. Fix README link to `docs/deliverables/Architecture.md` and expand architecture description.
3. Include a Dockerfile or remove instructions referencing it.

### Long-term
1. Abstract configuration (e.g., JSON file or environment vars) for future commands.
2. Consider mirroring Synthea JARs internally or bundling in container images to avoid GitHub outages.
3. Refactor Program.cs into separate command modules if feature set grows.
