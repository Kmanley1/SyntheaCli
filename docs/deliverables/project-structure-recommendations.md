# Project Structure Recommendations

| Issue | Current Path / Pattern | Recommended Change | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Many deliverables crowd the documentation folder | Files listed around lines 16‑31 in `project-structure.md`【F:docs/deliverables/project-structure.md†L16-L31】 | Move historical versions to an archive or replace them with unversioned living docs | Simplifies navigation |
| Setup script placed at repo root | `setup.sh` near lines 107‑116 of `project-structure.md`【F:docs/deliverables/project-structure.md†L107-L116】 | Relocate to `tools/` and update README links | Keeps root clean |
| Empty VS Code workspace file | `synthea-cli.code-workspace` contains only folder info【F:synthea-cli.code-workspace†L1-L8】 | Remove the file or expand it with meaningful settings | Avoids redundant configuration |
| Duplicate patterns in `.gitignore` | Repetition of `*.log` and `*.psess`【F:.gitignore†L46-L74】【F:.gitignore†L140-L160】 | Keep a single entry for each ignored pattern | Easier maintenance |
| Missing cross-platform ignores | `.gitignore` does not include `.DS_Store` or `Thumbs.db` | Add these entries under a new OS-specific section | Prevents stray files |
| Outdated ignore sections | Legacy Visual Studio 6 lines remain【F:.gitignore†L223-L240】 | Delete obsolete patterns | Focuses ignore rules |

Addressing these issues will streamline contributor onboarding, reduce noise in version control, and align the repository with common .NET conventions.
