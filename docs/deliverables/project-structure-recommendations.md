# Project Structure Recommendations

| Issue | Current Path / Pattern | Recommended Change | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Numerous deliverables clutter the docs folder | Files listed around lines 16‑31 in `project-structure.md`【F:docs/deliverables/project-structure.md†L16-L31】 | Move historical versions to an `archive/` subfolder or merge them into living docs | Easier navigation |
| Setup script placed at repo root | `setup.sh` line 115 in the tree【F:docs/deliverables/project-structure.md†L107-L116】 | Relocate to `tools/` and reference it from the README | Keeps root clean |
| VS Code workspace is mostly empty | `synthea-cli.code-workspace` lines 1‑8【F:synthea-cli.code-workspace†L1-L8】 | Remove the file or add meaningful settings and tasks | Avoids redundant configuration |
| Duplicate log patterns in `.gitignore` | Entries at lines 54 and 147‑153【F:.gitignore†L52-L58】【F:.gitignore†L145-L153】 | Keep one `*.log` entry near other build artifacts | Simplifies maintenance |
| `.vspscc` appears twice in `.gitignore` | Lines 55 and 201【F:.gitignore†L52-L56】【F:.gitignore†L200-L201】 | Consolidate into a single ignore rule | Reduces clutter |
| Outdated ignore rules linger | Guidance Automation Toolkit lines 227‑240【F:.gitignore†L220-L240】 | Remove obsolete patterns | Modernizes the list |
| Untracked test output listed in the tree | `TestResults/` lines 89‑94【F:docs/deliverables/project-structure.md†L88-L95】 | Ensure these directories are cleaned and ignored | Prevents accidental commits |

Addressing these gaps aligns the repository with common .NET conventions and improves contributor experience.
