# Project Structure Recommendations

The table below identifies structural issues found in the repository along with suggested improvements. Because the best-practices PDF could not be accessed, recommendations rely on the current tree and common .NET conventions.

| Issue | Current Path / Pattern | Recommended Change | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Redundant deliverables | Numerous versioned guideline files under `docs/deliverables` lines 16-39【F:docs/deliverables/project-structure.md†L16-L39】 | Move old versions to an archive folder or remove | Cleaner docs directory |
| Minimal workspace file | `synthea-cli.code-workspace` lacks tasks and settings【F:synthea-cli.code-workspace†L1-L8】 | Expand with shared tasks or remove in favor of `.vscode/` | Consistent tooling |
| Setup script at root | `setup.sh` located at repository root【F:docs/deliverables/project-structure.md†L120-L135】 | Move into `tools/` and link from README | Centralized onboarding |
| Duplicate `.gitignore` rules | Repeated patterns such as `*.log` and `*.psess`【F:.gitignore†L50-L74】【F:.gitignore†L146-L155】 | Keep only one instance of each pattern | Easier maintenance |
| Missing OS-specific ignores | No rules for `.DS_Store` or `Thumbs.db` | Add patterns near end of `.gitignore` | Prevents accidental commits |
| Outdated ignore sections | Legacy Visual Studio 6 and DocProject entries【F:.gitignore†L223-L240】 | Remove obsolete patterns | Focus on relevant tools |

**Mis-scoped or redundant patterns:**
- Duplicates for `*.dbmdl`, `*.bak`, and `*.backup`.
- `*.psess` appears twice in the ignore file.
- Old entries for LightSwitch and DocProject are unlikely to apply.

**Missing patterns:**
- `.DS_Store` and `Thumbs.db` for cross-platform development.
- Temporary output directories such as `tools/windows/temp/` if generated.

Updating the ignore file and relocating setup scripts will make the repository easier to navigate and maintain.
