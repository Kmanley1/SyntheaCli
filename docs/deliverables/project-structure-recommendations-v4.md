# Project Structure Recommendations

The table below identifies structural issues found in the repository along with suggested improvements. Because the best-practices PDF could not be read, recommendations are based on the repository tree and standard .NET guidelines.

| Issue | Current Path / Pattern | Recommended Change | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Duplicate `node_modules/` entries | Lines 221 and 272 in `.gitignore` list the folder twice【F:.gitignore†L221-L272】 | Remove one entry | Simpler ignore rules |
| Generic `.vscode/*` ignore conflicts with allowlist | Lines 159 and 335 in `.gitignore` conflict【F:.gitignore†L159-L340】 | Drop the earlier line and keep the allowlist | Prevents accidental exclusion of shared configs |
| `.vs/` pattern appears twice | `.gitignore` lines 78 and 309【F:.gitignore†L78-L309】 | Keep single entry near Visual Studio section | Avoids maintenance confusion |
| Outdated PDF ignores | Lines 352‑353 reference docs not in repo【F:.gitignore†L350-L353】 | Delete lines | Keep ignore file accurate |
| Test results committed previously | `tests/Synthea.Cli.IntegrationTests/obj` contains artifacts | Ensure `**/TestResults/` pattern is in `.gitignore` and clean directory | Keeps repository tidy |
| Workspace configuration minimal | `synthea-cli.code-workspace` only defines folders【F:synthea-cli.code-workspace†L1-L8】 | Expand or remove in favor of `.vscode/` | Clarifies configuration location |
| Setup script at root | `setup.sh` present in root tree lines 122‑131【F:docs/deliverables/project-structure.md†L122-L131】 | Move into `tools/` and document usage | Single onboarding entry point |
| Numerous historical docs | Many files under `docs/deliverables` lines 15‑35【F:docs/deliverables/project-structure.md†L15-L35】 | Archive or delete outdated versions | Reduce clutter |

## `.gitignore` Review
The current `.gitignore` follows common Visual Studio patterns but contains duplicates and entries for missing files.

**Redundant patterns:**
- `.vscode/*` listed twice (lines 159 and 335). Remove the first occurrence.
- `node_modules/` listed twice (lines 221 and 272). Keep one.
- `.vs/` listed twice (lines 78 and 309). Keep one.
- Two patterns for test results: `**/TestResults/` (line 3) and `[Tt]est[Rr]esult*/` (lines 101‑105). Consolidate to one.

**Mis-scoped or outdated patterns:**
- `docs/reference/Patterns_of_Enterprise_Application_Architecture.pdf` and `docs/reference/Optimizing_Microsoft_Azure_Workloads.pdf` are ignored but not present in the repository. Remove these lines.

**Missing patterns:**
- No rule for `coverage/` or other directories produced by coverage tools.
- No pattern for `*.nupkg` in case packages are generated locally.

Updating `.gitignore` to address these points will prevent accidental commits and make the file easier to maintain.
