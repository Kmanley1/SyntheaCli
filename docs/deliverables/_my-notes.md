# Iterative AI-Enabled Process

This deliverable explains how the project will use AI/ML techniques for continuous improvement. It follows an iterative Plan–Do–Check–Act cycle.

## Plan
- Leverage AI tooling to analyze code quality, test coverage, and issue history.
- Generate quarterly roadmaps automatically from repository metrics and backlog trends.

## Do
- Implement tasks from the roadmap during each iteration.
- Instrument the CLI to emit telemetry (opt-in) for usage and errors.

## Check
- Apply machine learning models to detect anomalies in telemetry and to predict areas of high risk or technical debt.
- Update the scorecard metrics to track progress over time.

## Act
- Feed insights back into the next planning cycle, adjusting priorities based on AI-driven recommendations.


write codex-task-health-check.md codex prompt

Research industry best practices for an automated ai run health check on software. 

Using the files prompts\codex-task-prompt-template.md and research\Comprehensive Codex Prompt Template and Best Practices.pdf write the prompt to perform the health check on synteha-cli

include in the health check prompt our prompts:
codex-task-architectural-eval.md which updates on-going-architectural-eval.md
codex-task-roadmap-update.md which updates on-going-roadmap.md

ai-change-log.md --> always updated
architecture.md --> describes solution architecture
