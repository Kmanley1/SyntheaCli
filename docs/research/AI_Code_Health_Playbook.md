# AI‑Driven Code‑Health Check – Playbook of Best Practices

## 1. What “good” looks like – process & tool‑chain

| Practice | Why it matters | Typical AI‑enabled tooling |
|----------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Shift‑left static analysis in CI** | Catch defects & policy violations every pull‑request (PR). | GitHub CodeQL, Checkmarx One, Semgrep AI, Amazon CodeGuru |
| **Security & quality dashboards** | Make risk visible to execs and engineers; trend KPIs such as “critical‑issues ≤ 0”. | SonarQube Quality Gate, Azure DevOps “Security” tab, Datadog Code Security |
| **Machine‑readable result formats** | Lets many scanners feed the same reports UI or ticket generator. | **SARIF 2.1** for SAST; **CycloneDX / SPDX SBOM** for dependency inventory |
| **Automated SBOM & vuln‑db correlation** | Required by U.S. Executive Order 14028 and most supply‑chain standards. | Syft + Grype, Snyk, Anchore, OWASP Dependency‑Track |
| **AI‑assisted code review comments** | Provides natural‑language rationale and fix snippets inside the PR while keeping humans in control. | GitHub Copilot “suggest review”, DeepCode PR bot |
| **Threat modelling as code** | Keeps architecture‑level risks version‑controlled next to source. | pytm, IriusRisk CLI, Microsoft TMT export |
| **Governance hooks** | Block merge when the Quality Gate or policy fails; auto‑open Jira tickets per finding. | SonarQube “Quality Gate”, GitHub required checks, Jira Automation |

## 2. Standard deliverables that stakeholders expect

| Deliverable | Purpose / Primary audience |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Assessment Charter & Scope doc** | Defines repos, branches, tools, severity cut‑offs. |
| **Architecture & Data‑Flow Diagrams** | Show trust boundaries and AI‑flagged “hot spots”. |
| **Threat‑Model Workbook** | Lists assets, threats, mitigations; maps to OWASP ASVS or NIST SSDF controls. |
| **Static‑Analysis Results (SARIF) Pack** | Machine‑readable artifact uploaded to code‑scanning UIs and archived for auditors. |
| **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** | CycloneDX JSON inventory + known‑vuln cross‑references; exported every pipeline run. |
| **Executive Summary PDF / Slide Deck** | 1‑page risk heat‑map, KPI trends, recommended next steps. |
| **Detailed Findings Report** | Maps each CVE/code‑smell to business impact & remediation guidance. |
| **Remediation Backlog** | CSV or Jira import containing tickets pre‑triaged by severity/owner. |
| **Metrics Dashboard Snapshot** | Export or API dump of quality/security KPIs at baseline *T₀* and each release gate. |
| **Roadmap & Maturity Growth Plan** | 3‑phase plan (Immediate < 30 d, Near‑term < 90 d, Continuous) aligned to OWASP SAMM or NIST RMF. |
| **Policy & Process Docs** | Secure‑coding standard; branch‑protection & scan gates; vulnerability SLA policy. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration (YAML)** | Version‑controlled file showing exact scanner versions, thresholds, and SBOM/SARIF upload steps. |
| **Compliance Mapping Matrix** | Links each finding/control to ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI‑DSS, etc. |

## 3. Putting it together – a minimal “starter kit”

```text
CI Pipeline
  ├─ codeql-action/analyze
  ├─ sonarsource/sonarcloud-scan
  └─ cyclonedx/cyclonedx-action
```

**Artifacts produced each run**

* `results.sarif`
* `bom.json`
* `sonar-report.pdf`

**Nightly job**

1. Aggregate SARIF → Jira  
2. Export Sonar KPI API → Grafana  
3. Store SBOM in Dependency‑Track  

**Quarterly milestone**

* Refresh Threat‑Model  
* Publish updated Roadmap deck  
* Compare KPI delta  

> Following this pattern keeps your **AI‑driven code‑health check** transparent, auditable, and actionable—from commit to boardroom.
